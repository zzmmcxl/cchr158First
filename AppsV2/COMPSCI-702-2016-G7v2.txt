We have implemented a simple application which supports playback of selected music files. The app initially imports and displays a list of all the music files that exist on the user's phone.
The user can then select certain songs they want to listen to by tapping them from the list, which will then be added to the user's custom playlist. 
The user can then playback the selected songs from the playlist screen by tapping "Play the List" (or delete them by tapping "Clear the List").

This application only runs on android devices with API level between 15 and 22.

Input: Music files from user's phone, user input
Output: Music playback
