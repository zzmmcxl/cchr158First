Enigma is an stegonography application for encoding secret messages into images.

The user enters the secret string message into the first text field, and then can
choose a picture to encode it into by hitting the "Pick image to encode" button.

After the user picks a picture, the application will encode the string into the 
pixels of the picture using a basic stegonography algorithm. After that is done,
the application will save the picture to the phones external storage.

The user can also decode messages from images by clicking on the "Decode" button 
and selecting a picture. The application will then decode the string from the 
picture and display it on the screen along with the selected picture.
