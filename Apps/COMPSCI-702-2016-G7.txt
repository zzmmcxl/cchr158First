We have implemented a simple application which supports playback of selected music files. The app intially imports and displays a list of all the music files that exist on the users phone.
The user can then select certain songs they want to listen to by tapping them from the list, which will then be added to the user's custom playlist. 
The user can then playback the selected songs from the playlist screen by tapping "Play the List" (or delete them by tapping "Clear the List").


Input: Music files from user's phone, user input
Output: Music playback
